{# Connection Validation Prompt Templates #}

{# Main validation prompt template #}
{% macro validation_prompt(connection, context) -%}
Validate the following connection between two locations for logical consistency and quality.

## Connection to Validate
**Connection Type**: {{ connection.properties.connection_type }}
**Description**: {{ connection.properties.description }}
**Difficulty**: {{ connection.properties.difficulty }}/10
**Travel Time**: {{ connection.properties.travel_time }} seconds
**Visibility**: {{ connection.properties.visibility }}
**Requirements**: {{ connection.properties.requirements | join(', ') if connection.properties.requirements else 'None' }}
**Reversible**: {{ 'Yes' if connection.properties.reversible else 'No' }}

## Location Context
**Source**: {{ context.source_location.name }} ({{ context.source_location.state_flags.theme }})
**Target**: {{ context.target_location.name }} ({{ context.target_location.state_flags.theme }})
**Generation Purpose**: {{ context.generation_purpose }}

## Validation Criteria
Evaluate the connection on the following aspects:

### 1. Logical Consistency
- Does the connection type make sense for these location themes?
- Is the difficulty appropriate for the connection type and terrain?
- Is the travel time realistic for the difficulty and connection type?
- Are the requirements logical and not contradictory?

### 2. Thematic Appropriateness
- Does the connection fit the visual and narrative style of both locations?
- Are the materials and construction methods appropriate for the setting?
- Does the description enhance the world's atmosphere?

### 3. Gameplay Balance
- Is the difficulty fair for players at the expected level?
- Does the connection provide interesting gameplay choices?
- Are the requirements not overly restrictive?

### 4. Description Quality
- Is the description vivid and immersive?
- Does it provide enough detail without being overwhelming?
- Does it inspire the imagination and enhance the experience?

{# Theme consistency validation #}
{% macro theme_consistency_prompt(connection_type, source_theme, target_theme) -%}
Evaluate whether a {{ connection_type }} connection is thematically appropriate between a {{ source_theme }} location and a {{ target_theme }} location.

Consider:
- Architectural styles and materials typical of each theme
- Natural barriers or facilitators between these location types
- Cultural and technological appropriateness
- Visual and atmospheric consistency

Rate the thematic consistency from 0.0 (completely inappropriate) to 1.0 (perfectly fitting).

{# Difficulty assessment validation #}
{% macro difficulty_assessment_prompt(connection_type, difficulty, travel_time, requirements) -%}
Assess whether the difficulty rating of {{ difficulty }}/10 is appropriate for this connection:

**Connection Details**:
- Type: {{ connection_type }}
- Travel Time: {{ travel_time }} seconds
- Requirements: {{ requirements | join(', ') if requirements else 'None' }}

**Validation Questions**:
1. Does the difficulty match the expected physical/mental challenge?
2. Is the travel time proportional to the difficulty?
3. Do the requirements justify the difficulty level?
4. Would players find this difficulty fair and reasonable?

Provide a score from 0.0 (completely inappropriate) to 1.0 (perfectly calibrated).
{%- endmacro %}

{# Description quality validation #}
{% macro description_quality_prompt(description, connection_type) -%}
Evaluate the quality of this {{ connection_type }} description:

"{{ description }}"

**Quality Criteria**:
1. **Vividness**: Does it paint a clear mental picture?
2. **Immersion**: Does it draw the reader into the world?
3. **Specificity**: Are details concrete and meaningful?
4. **Atmosphere**: Does it convey the right mood and feeling?
5. **Clarity**: Is it easy to understand and visualize?
6. **Appropriateness**: Does it fit the connection type and setting?

Rate each criterion from 0.0 to 1.0, then provide an overall quality score.
{%- endmacro %}

{# Requirements validation #}
{% macro requirements_validation_prompt(requirements, connection_type, themes) -%}
Validate these connection requirements: {{ requirements | join(', ') }}

**Context**:
- Connection Type: {{ connection_type }}
- Location Themes: {{ themes | join(' to ') }}

**Validation Checks**:
1. Are the requirements logical for this connection type?
2. Are they achievable by players at appropriate levels?
3. Do they enhance gameplay without being overly restrictive?
4. Are there any contradictory or impossible requirements?
5. Do they fit the thematic setting?

Identify any problematic requirements and suggest improvements.
