# Fixes Applied

## Fixed Issues

1. Created a pytest.ini configuration with the proper asyncio settings:
   ```
   [pytest]
   asyncio_mode = strict
   asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = function
   asyncio_default_test_loop_scope = function
   testpaths = tests
   python_files = test_*.py
   python_classes = Test*
   python_functions = test_*
   ```

2. Fixed the testing fixtures in `test_entity_embedding_integration.py`:
   - Imported `pytest_asyncio`
   - Changed `@pytest.fixture` to `@pytest_asyncio.fixture` for async fixtures
   - Fixed the MockOllamaClient to implement the `generate_embeddings` method that the EmbeddingService expects

3. Added type annotations to functions in analytics.py:
   - Added TYPE_CHECKING import for forward references
   - Fixed duplicate variable names causing errors
   - Added explicit type annotations to avoid Any return type errors

## Remaining Issues

There still appear to be issues with:

1. Line length in various files (many lines exceed 79 characters)
2. Some mypy issues in the analytics.py file that need more investigation

## Next Steps

1. Fix line length issues in all files
2. Resolve any remaining mypy errors
3. Make sure all tests pass
