# Commit Implementation Plan Creation Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidance for creating and maintaining commit implementation plan documents in the `/docs/implementation/commit_plans/` folder. These plans serve as comprehensive blueprints for implementing complex features or system changes within the game loop project.

## Purpose

Commit implementation plans:
- Provide detailed roadmaps for complex feature implementations
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of requirements, testing, and integration
- Serve as documentation for future reference and maintenance
- Enable systematic development with clear verification criteria
- Facilitate code review by providing implementation context

## Document Structure

### 1. Header Section
```markdown
# Commit X: [Feature Name]

## Overview
Brief description of what this commit implements and how it builds upon previous work.

## Goals
1. Clear, numbered list of primary objectives
2. Specific, measurable outcomes
3. Integration targets with existing systems
```

### 2. Implementation Tasks
Break down the work into logical modules/components:

```markdown
### X. Component Name (`file/path/component.py`)

**Purpose**: Clear statement of what this component does.

**Key Components**:
- List of major features/capabilities
- Integration points
- Performance considerations

**Methods to Implement**:
```python
class ComponentClass:
    def method_name(self, params) -> ReturnType:
        """Method docstring explaining purpose and behavior"""
```
```

### 3. File Structure
```markdown
## File Structure
```
src/game_loop/
├── module/
│   ├── component.py          # Brief description
│   ├── other_component.py    # Brief description
```
```

### 4. Testing Strategy
Organize by test type:

```markdown
### Unit Tests
1. **Component Tests** (`tests/unit/module/test_component.py`):
   - Test individual method behaviors
   - Test error conditions
   - Test edge cases

### Integration Tests
1. **System Integration** (`tests/integration/module/test_integration.py`):
   - Test component interactions
   - Test with real dependencies

### Performance Tests
1. **Benchmark Tests** (`tests/performance/test_performance.py`):
   - Test performance characteristics
   - Test scaling behavior
```

### 5. Verification Criteria
Use checkboxes to track completion:

```markdown
## Verification Criteria

### Functional Verification
- [ ] Feature works as specified
- [ ] Integration points function correctly
- [ ] Error handling works properly

### Performance Verification
- [ ] Meets performance targets (specify metrics)
- [ ] Memory usage within bounds
- [ ] Scaling characteristics acceptable

### Integration Verification
- [ ] Compatible with existing systems
- [ ] API contracts maintained
- [ ] Database integrity preserved
```

### 6. Dependencies and Configuration
```markdown
## Dependencies
### New Dependencies
- List any new packages or libraries required

### Configuration Updates
- Configuration changes needed
- Environment variable additions
- Database schema changes
```

### 7. Integration Points
```markdown
## Integration Points
1. **With System A**: Description of integration
2. **With System B**: Description of integration
```

### 8. Migration Considerations
```markdown
## Migration Considerations
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Data migration needs
- Deployment considerations
- Rollback procedures
```

### 9. Code Quality Requirements
```markdown
## Code Quality Requirements
- [ ] All code passes linting (black, ruff, mypy)
- [ ] Comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Type hints for all functions
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Logging added where appropriate
```

### 10. Documentation Updates
```markdown
## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files
- [ ] Add new guides if needed
- [ ] Update architecture diagrams
- [ ] Add examples and usage patterns
```

### 11. Future Considerations
```markdown
## Future Considerations
Brief description of how this implementation supports future enhancements.
```

## Best Practices

### Planning Phase
1. **Research Existing Code**: Review related modules and patterns before planning
2. **Identify Integration Points**: Map out all systems that will be affected
3. **Define Clear Interfaces**: Specify APIs and data contracts upfront
4. **Consider Performance**: Include performance requirements and constraints
5. **Plan for Testability**: Design components to be easily testable

### Implementation Phase
1. **Follow Incremental Development**: Break large tasks into smaller, verifiable steps
2. **Update Verification Criteria**: Check off completed items as you go
3. **Document Changes**: Note any deviations from the original plan
4. **Test Continuously**: Run tests as features are implemented

### Review Phase
1. **Verify All Criteria**: Ensure all checkboxes are completed
2. **Review Integration**: Test integration points thoroughly
3. **Performance Validation**: Confirm performance targets are met
4. **Documentation Review**: Ensure documentation is complete and accurate

## Quality Standards

### Technical Standards
- All code must pass the project's linting requirements
- Comprehensive type hints are mandatory
- Error handling must be implemented for all external dependencies
- Performance-critical code must include profiling annotations

### Documentation Standards
- Every public method requires a docstring
- Complex algorithms need inline comments
- Integration points must be clearly documented
- Examples should be provided for complex APIs

### Testing Standards
- Unit tests for all public methods
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Error condition testing for failure scenarios

## Naming Conventions

### File Names
- Use descriptive names: `commit_XX_implementation_plan.md`
- Include commit number for easy reference
- Use underscores for separation

### Section Headers
- Use consistent header levels
- Number major sections for easy reference
- Include file paths in component descriptions

### Code Examples
- Include realistic parameter names
- Show return types clearly
- Use proper Python syntax
- Include docstrings in examples

## Common Patterns

### For Database Integration
1. Always include schema definitions
2. Plan for migrations and rollbacks
3. Include performance considerations for queries
4. Test with realistic data volumes

### For API Development
1. Define clear request/response formats
2. Include error handling patterns
3. Plan for rate limiting and security
4. Document all endpoints thoroughly

### For Game Systems
1. Consider real-time performance requirements
2. Plan for state persistence
3. Include player experience considerations
4. Test with concurrent players

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Review plans quarterly for accuracy
- Update with lessons learned from implementation
- Revise future considerations based on actual development
- Archive completed plans but keep accessible

### Version Control
- Track changes to plans in git
- Include reasoning for major revisions
- Link to related implementation commits
- Maintain change history for reference

## Template Usage

Use this structure as a template for new commit plans:
1. Copy the structure outlined above
2. Fill in project-specific details
3. Adapt sections based on the type of work
4. Remove irrelevant sections if necessary
5. Add project-specific sections as needed

Remember: The goal is to create comprehensive, actionable plans that guide implementation and serve as valuable documentation for the project's evolution.
