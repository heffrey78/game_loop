# Commit 25: Location Generation System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This commit implements the LocationGenerator system that uses LLM to dynamically create new locations based on game context, player history, and world themes. This builds upon the world boundaries and navigation system (Commit 24) to enable dynamic world expansion when players explore beyond existing areas.

## Goals
1. Implement LLM-powered location generation with contextual awareness
2. Create location theme management and consistency validation
3. Integrate location storage with embedding generation for semantic search
4. Implement location retrieval and caching systems
5. Establish connection generation for seamless world expansion
6. Enable context collection from player history and adjacent locations

## Scope

### Core Components to Implement

#### 1. LocationGenerator (`src/game_loop/core/world/location_generator.py`)

**Purpose**: Generate new locations using LLM with context awareness and theme consistency.

**Key Components**:
- LLM-based location creation with contextual prompts
- Theme consistency validation and management
- Location property generation (descriptions, objects, NPCs)
- Integration with world boundaries for expansion triggering
- Context enrichment from player history and adjacent areas

**Methods to Implement**:
```python
class LocationGenerator:
    def __init__(self, llm_client: OllamaClient, world_state: WorldState):
        """Initialize with LLM client and world state access"""
    
    async def generate_location(
        self, context: LocationGenerationContext
    ) -> GeneratedLocation:
        """Generate a new location based on provided context"""
    
    async def validate_location_consistency(
        self, location: GeneratedLocation, adjacent_locations: List[Location]
    ) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate location consistency with adjacent areas"""
    
    async def enrich_location_context(
        self, base_context: LocationGenerationContext
    ) -> EnrichedContext:
        """Enhance context with player history and world themes"""
    
    async def generate_location_connections(
        self, location: GeneratedLocation, boundary_point: ExpansionPoint
    ) -> List[LocationConnection]:
        """Generate appropriate connections for the new location"""
```

#### 2. LocationThemeManager (`src/game_loop/core/world/theme_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Manage location themes and ensure consistency across the generated world.

    ) -> bool:
        """Validate theme consistency with surrounding areas"""
    
    async def get_theme_transition_rules(
        self, from_theme: LocationTheme, to_theme: LocationTheme
    ) -> ThemeTransitionRules:
        """Get rules for transitioning between themes"""
    
    async def generate_theme_specific_content(
        self, theme: LocationTheme, location_type: str
    ) -> ThemeContent:
        """Generate theme-specific content elements"""
```

#### 3. LocationContextCollector (`src/game_loop/core/world/context_collector.py`)

**Purpose**: Collect and analyze context for location generation from various sources.

**Key Components**:

**Methods to Implement**:
```python
class LocationContextCollector:
    def __init__(self, world_state: WorldState, player_tracker: PlayerStateTracker):
        """Initialize with state trackers"""
    
    async def collect_expansion_context(
        self, expansion_point: ExpansionPoint
    ) -> LocationGenerationContext:
        """Collect comprehensive context for location generation"""
    
    async def analyze_player_preferences(
        self, player_id: UUID
    ) -> PlayerLocationPreferences:
        """Analyze player's location preferences from history"""
    
    async def gather_adjacent_context(
        self, location_id: UUID, direction: str
    ) -> AdjacentLocationContext:
        """Gather context from locations adjacent to expansion point"""
    
    async def extract_narrative_context(
        self, player_id: UUID, location_area: str
    ) -> NarrativeContext:
        """Extract relevant narrative context for generation"""

## LLM Integration

### Location Generation Prompts
```jinja2
{# templates/location_generation/location_prompts.j2 #}
You are generating a new location for a text adventure game.

Context:
- Direction from current location: {{ expansion_point.direction }}
- Current location: {{ current_location.name }} - {{ current_location.description }}
- Player has visited: {{ player_context.visited_locations | length }} locations
- World theme: {{ world_theme }}
- Desired atmosphere: {{ desired_atmosphere }}

Adjacent locations:
{% for location in adjacent_locations %}
- {{ location.direction }}: {{ location.name }} - {{ location.short_description }}
{% endfor %}

Player preferences (based on history):
- Preferred environments: {{ player_preferences.environments | join(", ") }}
- Interaction style: {{ player_preferences.interaction_style }}
- Complexity preference: {{ player_preferences.complexity_level }}

Generate a new location that:
1. Fits naturally with the surrounding areas
2. Matches the world theme and atmosphere
3. Provides appropriate content for the player's experience level
4. Includes 2-3 interesting features or objects
5. Has a compelling reason for existing in this location

Format your response as JSON with these fields:
- name: Location name (2-4 words)
- description: Full location description (2-3 paragraphs)
- short_description: Brief description for maps/travel
- theme: Primary theme for this location
- atmosphere: Emotional tone/feeling
- objects: List of 2-3 notable objects
- potential_npcs: List of 1-2 potential NPCs that would fit
- connections: Suggested connections to other directions
- special_features: Any unique interactive elements
```

### Theme Consistency Validation
```jinja2
{# templates/location_generation/validation_prompts.j2 #}
Evaluate if this generated location fits well with its surroundings:

Generated Location:
Name: {{ location.name }}
Description: {{ location.description }}
Theme: {{ location.theme }}

Adjacent Locations:
{% for adj in adjacent_locations %}
- {{ adj.direction }}: {{ adj.name }} ({{ adj.theme }}) - {{ adj.short_description }}
{% endfor %}

World Rules:
{{ world_rules | join('\n') }}

Rate the consistency (1-10) and explain any issues:
1. Thematic consistency with adjacent areas
2. Logical placement and connections
3. Appropriate complexity for game progression
4. Uniqueness without being jarring
5. Interactive potential and player interest

Provide response as JSON:
- overall_score: 1-10
- thematic_score: 1-10
- logical_score: 1-10
- complexity_score: 1-10
- uniqueness_score: 1-10
- issues: List of problems found
- suggestions: List of improvements
- approval: true/false for whether to use this location
```

## Migration Considerations

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing locations remain unchanged
- New generation system only affects new location creation
- Existing theme data can be migrated to new theme system

### Data Migration
- No existing data migration required
- New tables are additive to existing schema
- Default themes can be populated from configuration

### Deployment Considerations
- Requires LLM availability for location generation
- Database migration must complete before location generation
- Cache warming may be beneficial for performance

- New tables can be dropped if rollback needed
- Location generation can be disabled via configuration
- Fallback to manual location creation if needed

## Code Quality Requirements

- [ ] All code passes linting (black, ruff, mypy)
- [ ] Comprehensive docstrings for all public methods
- [ ] Type hints for all function parameters and returns
- [ ] Error handling for LLM timeouts and failures

- [ ] Add performance tuning guide for location generation
- [ ] Create examples of custom themes and validation rules

## Future Considerations

This location generation system provides the foundation for:

1. **Advanced Theme Systems**: More sophisticated theme hierarchies and inheritance
2. **Player-Driven Generation**: Allowing players to influence or request specific types of locations
3. **Procedural Narratives**: Generating locations that support ongoing storylines
4. **Dynamic Ecosystems**: Locations that evolve based on player actions and time
5. **Multi-Modal Generation**: Incorporating visual or audio elements into location generation
6. **Collaborative Generation**: Multiple players influencing shared world generation

The system's modular design and comprehensive context collection enable these future enhancements without requiring architectural changes.
