# Use Handler Refactoring - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The refactoring of the `UseHandler` class has been successfully completed according to the plan. This refactoring implements a nested Strategy pattern with a Factory to handle different item usage scenarios in a more maintainable and extensible way.

## Changes Made

1. **Created Directory Structure**:
   - Created `/src/game_loop/core/command_handlers/use_handler/` directory
   - Set up proper package initialization

2. **Created Base Interface**:
   - Implemented `UsageHandler` abstract base class with:
     - `validate()` method to check if usage is valid
     - `handle()` method to process the usage and return results

3. **Implemented Specialized Handlers**:
   - `ContainerUsageHandler`: For "put X in Y" usage scenarios
   - `TargetUsageHandler`: For "use X on Y" usage scenarios
   - `SelfUsageHandler`: For using an item by itself

4. **Created Handler Factory**:
   - Implemented `UsageHandlerFactory` to create the appropriate handler
   - Moved detection logic like `_is_container_usage()` from `UseHandler` to factory

5. **Simplified UseHandler**:
   - Removed scenario-specific handling code
   - Added factory usage to delegate to specialized handlers
   - Maintained core validation and item lookup

6. **Added Tests**:
   - Created tests to verify the factory returns correct handlers
   - Added tests to ensure the delegation pattern works correctly

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Maintenance**: Each usage scenario is now encapsulated in its own class, making the code more focused and easier to maintain.

2. **Enhanced Extensibility**: New usage types (like "combine X with Y" or "attach X to Y") can be added by creating new handler classes without modifying the existing code.

3. **Better Separation of Concerns**:
   - Detection of usage type is now in the factory
   - Core handler management is in the main `UseHandler`
   - Specific processing logic is in specialized handlers

4. **Reduced Complexity**: The main `UseHandler` class is now simpler and focused on coordination rather than implementation details.

5. **Improved Testability**: Each handler and the factory can be tested in isolation, making it easier to write comprehensive tests.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Registration System**: Add a dynamic registration system for new usage handlers

2. **Configuration-based Handlers**: Enable loading handlers from configuration

3. **Plugin Architecture**: Allow third-party code to extend the usage scenarios

4. **Composition**: Enable composition of handlers for complex scenarios

## Conclusion

The refactored code follows best practices for object-oriented design, particularly the Strategy and Factory patterns. This will make the code more maintainable as additional usage scenarios are added and provide a framework for future extensions to the game's interaction system.
