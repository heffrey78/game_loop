## Development Workflow

For each commit checkpoint:

1. **Branch Creation**: Create a feature branch from main
2. **Implementation**: Implement the planned features
3. **Testing**: Write and run tests for new functionality
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Code Review**: Perform self-review and refactoring
6. **Merge**: Merge the feature branch into main

## Implementation Notes

- **Test-Driven Development**: Where possible, write tests before implementation
- **Modular Design**: Keep components loosely coupled with clear interfaces
- **Documentation**: Document as you go, especially for complex components
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each component in isolation before integration
- **Performance Monitoring**: Add instrumentation for key operations to identify bottlenecks early
- **Flexibility**: Be prepared to adjust the plan as implementation challenges arise

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing the Game Loop system, with clear checkpoints for progress evaluation and testing.
