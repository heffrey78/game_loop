## Input Processing Prompts

### 1. Intent Recognition Prompt

**Purpose**: Determine the player's intent from natural language input.

```
You are an intent recognition system for a text adventure game. Your task is to analyze the player's input and determine their intent.

Player's current location: {{current_location_name}}
Player's current state: {{player_state_summary}}

Player input: "{{player_input}}"

Identify the primary intent from the following categories:
- MOVE (movement to another location)
- EXAMINE (inspect an object or location)
- TAKE (add item to inventory)
- USE (use an object or item)
- COMBINE (combine multiple items)
- TALK (initiate conversation)
- ASK (ask about a topic during conversation)
- SEARCH (look for hidden objects)
- ATTACK (engage in combat)
- SYSTEM (save, load, help, etc.)
- CUSTOM (does not fit the above categories)

For the identified intent, extract:
1. The primary action verb
2. The target object(s) or direction
3. Any modifiers or secondary objects
4. Contextual requirements

Format your response as a JSON object without explanation.
```

### 2. Input Disambiguation Prompt

The ambiguous command is: "{{player_input}}"

Possible interpretations:
{{possible_interpretations}}

Based on the context, determine the most likely interpretation of the player's command. If still ambiguous, create a question that would help clarify the player's intent.

Format your response as:
{
  "most_likely_interpretation": "description of most likely intent",
  "confidence": 0-100,
  "clarification_needed": true/false,
  "clarification_question": "question to ask player if needed"

## Prompt Templates Usage Guidelines

### Variable Format

All variables in these prompts follow the format `{{variable_name}}`. When implementing these prompts in your system:

1. Replace these variables with actual data from your game state
2. Ensure all variables are populated before sending to the LLM
3. Use default values for optional variables when actual data is not available

### Response Formats

Prompts specify different response formats:
- JSON: For structured data that needs to be parsed by the system
- Prose: For narrative content that will be displayed directly to the player

### Prompt Customization

These prompts should be customized for your specific game:
1. Adjust the tone to match your game's narrative voice
2. Add specific world rules unique to your game setting
3. Modify response formats to match your internal data structures
4. Add or remove sections based on your game's complexity

### System Context

Each prompt assumes the LLM has some basic understanding of text adventure game mechanics. For optimal results:

1. Consider including a standard "system" message that establishes the game's genre and tone
2. Maintain conversation history when appropriate to provide context
3. Include examples of desired outputs for complex prompts
4. Test and iterate on prompts with your specific LLM to optimize performance
