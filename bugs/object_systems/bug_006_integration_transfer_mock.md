# Bug Report

## Bug Information
- **Bug ID**: OBJ-006
- **Date Created**: 2024-01-10
- **Reporter**: Claude Code Assistant
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Open
- **Component**: ObjectSystemIntegration

## Summary
ObjectSystemIntegration transfer_items action not calling inventory.move_item as expected

## Description
When processing a "transfer_items" action through the unified action processor, the underlying inventory.move_item method is not being called, causing test assertions to fail.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create ObjectSystemIntegration with mocked inventory manager
2. Call process_unified_action with "transfer_items" action type
3. Check if inventory.move_item was called
4. Assertion fails because method was not called

## Expected Behavior
The transfer_items action should call the inventory manager's move_item method to transfer items between inventories.

## Actual Behavior
The move_item method is not called, suggesting the action routing or implementation is incorrect.

## Test Information
- **Test File**: tests/unit/core/objects/test_object_integration.py
- **Test Method**: TestObjectSystemIntegration::test_process_unified_action_transfer_items
- **Test Command**: `poetry run python -m pytest tests/unit/core/objects/test_object_integration.py::TestObjectSystemIntegration::test_process_unified_action_transfer_items -v`

## Error Details
```
AssertionError: Expected 'move_item' to have been called.
```

## Stack Trace
```
tests/unit/core/objects/test_object_integration.py:XXX: in test_process_unified_action_transfer_items
    integration_system.inventory.move_item.assert_called()
E   AssertionError: Expected 'move_item' to have been called.
```

## Environment
- **Python Version**: 3.12.4
- **OS**: Linux
- **Git Commit**: Current working directory

## Investigation Notes
The _process_transfer_action method in ObjectSystemIntegration may not be properly implemented or the action routing logic may not be correctly directing transfer_items actions to this method.

## Potential Solutions
- Verify _process_transfer_action method implementation
- Check action type routing in process_unified_action
- Ensure proper parameter extraction from action_data
- Fix any issues in the transfer logic

## Related Issues
- May indicate broader issues with ObjectSystemIntegration action routing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] transfer_items action properly calls inventory.move_item
- [ ] Action parameters are correctly passed to move_item
- [ ] Test test_process_unified_action_transfer_items passes
- [ ] Integration action routing works correctly
